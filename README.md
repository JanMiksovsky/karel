This project contains a [Karel](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karel_(programming_language)>) interpreter I wrote in high school and posted on the Usenet group net.sources on 1985-06-11 with the following note:

```
Last year, I wrote an interpreter for the Karel language to help introduce
students here taking structured programming courses. The language is
very simple, but is more fun for new programmers to use than Pascal since it
is more visually-oriented. I'm running this on a VAX 11/750 under 4.2 BSD,
and I haven't found any problems (yet :-) .

Mail comments, bug reports, suggestions, etc. to me, *please*.
A demo program, maze.k, is enclosed. To run it, type "karel maze.k" and
press the return key after the maze is loaded in.

Enjoy.

This Karel interpreter was used at several schools, and formed the basis for at least [one other Karel implementation](https://karel.sourceforge.net/doc/html_chapter/karel_1.html).
